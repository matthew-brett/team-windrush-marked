    "In this project, we will be investigating government deporation data. In particular, we are interested in deporations which might be connected to the Windrush Scandal.\n",
    "Uncovered in 2018 by journalists, the windrush scandal is the political scandal in which the Home Office was discovered to have detained, threatened and deported people, illegally, from the UK. It is known as the 'Windrush' scandal after the Empire Windrush, a ship which transported many people from the Carribean to the UK in the late 1940s. The generation of people who travelled to the UK from the late 1940s to early 1970s are therefore known as the Windrush Generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "As more stories of unlawful treatment were uncovered by the guardian, the scandal gained public awareness and led to the resignation of the then home secretary Amber Rudd. The prime minister issued an apology about the treatment of Windrush citizens to Carribbean leaders and promised that the scandal would end. The current Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, also vowed to put an end to the scandal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial question of the project was to answer the question: Has the Windrush Scandal really ended?\n",
    "\n",
    "However, after deeper analysis of the data (see further down in the notebook), it became apparent that we were unable to answer this question with the data availble.\n",
    "\n",
